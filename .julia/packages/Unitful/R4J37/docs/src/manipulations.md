## Dimension and unit inspection

We define a function [`dimension`](@ref) that turns, for example, `acre^2` or `1*acre^2`
into `ùêã^4`. We can usually add quantities with the same dimension, regardless of specific
units (`FixedUnits` cannot be automatically converted, however). Note that dimensions cannot
be determined by powers of the units: `ft^2` is an area, but so is `ac^1` (an acre).

There is also a function [`unit`](@ref) that turns, for example, `1*acre^2` into `acre^2`.
You can then query whether the units are `FreeUnits`, `FixedUnits`, etc.
